## Recreating COVID-19 charts with Johns Hopkins CSSE data and matplotlib

There are many graphs and charts produced for news articles that are "frozen"
in time. This repo attempts to re-create those graphs and charts but with
updated versions as more data become available.

I've chosen to use the [Johns Hopkins CSSE COVID-19 repo](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
as source for all data. Mostly because it's convenient but also because a lot
of people seem to use it already.
